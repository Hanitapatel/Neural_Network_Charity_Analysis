# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks create binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if founded by Aplhbet Soup by using machine learing and neural networks. 

## Results
- Data Processing
    - Column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is considerd target variable
    - ![Text to Column]()
    - All the columns excluding "EIN" and "NAME" coulumns are considered to be features variables.
    - "EIN" and "NAME' coulumns are considered neither targets nor features and removed from the input data.
    - ![Text to Column]()
    
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - We use 110 neurons, two input layers and one outpot layer
    - We were not able to achieved the target model performance of 75%. We achived Accuracy of 72.6% and Loss 55.6%.
    - ![Text to Column]()
    - In ordere to incress the prformance of our model we bin two more coulmns "AFFILIATION" and "ORGANIZATION" columns. We also add one more hidden layer.

## Summary
 Deep learning model did not reached the accuracy of 75%
